A Simple Python Project Skeleton
================================

This repo attempts to standardize the structure of the Python-based project's repositories using
modern Python packaging and configuration techniques that can then be applied to many repos.

Using this `blog post`_ as inspiration, this repository serves as the base for all new Python
projects and is mergeable in existing repositories as well.

Usage
=====

A brand new project
-------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    git init my-new-repo
    cd my-new-repo
    git pull git@github.com:nexB/skeleton

    # Create the new repo on GitHub, then update your remote
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:nexB/your-new-repo.git

From here, you can make the appropriate changes to the files for your specific project.

Update an existing project
---------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    cd my-existing-project
    git remote add skeleton git@github.com:nexB/skeleton
    git fetch skeleton
    git merge skeleton/main --allow-unrelated-histories

This is also the workflow to use when updating the skeleton files in any given repository.

More usage instructions can be found in ``docs/skeleton-usage.rst``.
